Get Eigen from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Projects_using_Eigen
Just extract and put it under the eigen-3.3.7 folder (folder name may change if a newer version is used)
The compiler needs to find the headers, that's all, it's a header-only library, so no need to worry about linking etc.

LBFGSpp is downloaded from https://github.com/yixuan/LBFGSpp, downloaded master on 2020-05-19. Just extract under dependencies
under LBFGSpp-master. This is also header-only.
