Use good toulmin 2x

Set bucket include = 4
set bucket use = 5
set num buckets = 2

gene 0 histogram:
5 2 tot count 7 -> pred = 7 + 5-2 = 10, frac ones ~ 0.71
gene 1 histogram:
3 2 2 1 1 1 tot count 10 -> pred = 10 + 3-2+2-1+1-1 = 12, frac ones = 0.3
gene 2 histogram:
4 0.5 tot count 4.5 ->pred = 4.5 + 4-0.5 = 8, frac ones ~ 0.88
gene 3 histogram:
1 0.5 tot count 1.5 -> pred = 1.5 + 1-0.5 = 2, frac ones ~ 0.66
gene 4 histogram:
0 1 tot count 1 -> pred = -1, i.e. 0, frac ones = 0
gene 5 histogram:
2 1 1 1 1 1 1 tot count 8 -> pred = 8 + 2-1 +1-1 +1-1 +1 = 10, frac ones = 0.25

so, gene 0, 1, 2 and 5 will be used for buckets; 0.71, 0.3, 0.88 0.25
gene 1 and 5 will end up in bucket one
gene 0 and 2 will end up in bucket 2

Bucket 1 histogram:
Gene 1: 3 2 2 1 1 1 
Gene 5: 2 1 1 1 1 1 1
Bucket: 5 3 3 2 2 2 1 tot count 18, pred = 18 + 5-3 + 3-2 + 2-2 + 1 = 22, frac ones = 5/18 ~ 0.28, scaling = 22/18 ~1.22

Bucket 2 histogram:
Gene 0: 5 2 
Gene 2: 4 0.5
Bucket: 9 2.5 tot count 11.5, pred = 11.5 + 9-2.5 = 18, frac ones = 9/11.5 ~ 0.78, scaling = 18/11.5 ~ 1.565

pred genes:
0	direct	10
1	direct	12
2	bucket	4.5*18/11.5	#maps to bucket 2, so 4.5*18/11.5
3	bucket	1.5*18/11.5	#maps to bucket 2, so 1.5*18/11.5
4	bucket	1*22/18	#maps to bucket 1, so 1*22/18
5	direct	10

tot counts = 7 + 10 + 4.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 8 = 32
tot pred counts = 10 + 12 + 6*18/11.5 + 22/18 + 10 ~ 42.61353

global scaling for pred to get the same total counts after pred is 
gsc = 32/42.61353

scaling per gene is (see excel sheet for calculations):
0	1.072764669
1	0.901122322
2	1.175376941
3	1.175376941
4	0.917809772
5	0.938669085

the expected unscaled count matrix should look like this (cell barcodes and genes need to be added by 1 in the real expected file, since it is not zero indexed)
0	0	7
1	1	10
1	2	1
2	2	3
3	2	0.5
3	3	1.5
4	4	1
5	5	8

the expected scaled count matrix (zero indexed still):
0	0	7.509352681
1	1	9.011223217
1	2	4.701507766
2	2	0.587688471
2	3	1.763065412
2	4	0.917809772
3	5	7.509352681

the expected non zero-indexed matrix:
1	1	7.509352681
2	2	9.011223217
2	3	4.701507766
3	3	0.587688471
3	4	1.763065412
3	5	0.917809772
4	6	7.509352681
