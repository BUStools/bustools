#Test for the collapse function. 
#What we need to test is that 
#1. Different ecs with the same UMI and barcode leads to that they are merged to the same gene - these two should be merged
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	ATGGAAATTT	1	4
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	ATGGAAATTT	2	3

#2. Identical ecs with same barcode and different UMI should not be merged
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	ATGAAAATTT	1	1
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	ATGAAAATTA	1	1

#3. Identical barcode and UMI should lead to the set intersection of genes - these should be merged with gene set to 2
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	GTGGAAATTT	9	4
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	GTGGAAATTT	10	3
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	GTGGAAATTT	13	3

#4. Sometimes you get more than one gene - should be merged with gene set to 2,4, but discarded here since we do not keep multimapped molecules
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	ATGGAAATTT	13	4
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	ATGGAAATTT	10	3

#5. No overlap between genes, should be discarded
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	CTGGAAATTT	2	4
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	CTGGAAATTT	10	3

#6. Identical ecs with different barcode and same UMI should not be merged
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCA	ATGAAAATAA	1	1
AAACCTGAGAAGCCCT	ATGAAAATAA	1	1
